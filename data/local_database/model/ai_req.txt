Create a ExerciseDefinition List from the exercises:

Here is an example:


If you can Then create test to test the output and verify the result is correct for each ExerciseDefinitionan?If some exercises reject the test declare them in next response.

Step 1:

I will send you po messages file for instructions and prepration and key tips for each exercise.

for example for "Ab Wheel" we have a title id that is E_D_AB_WHEEL_TITLE and we have two prepration steps

and three execution steps and  we have 2 tips to create an ExerciseDefinition model.



msgid "E_D_AB_WHEEL_TITLE"

msgstr "Ab Wheel"



msgid "E_D_AB_WHEEL_PREP_ONE"

msgstr "Put the wheel roller right under your shoulders on the floor."



msgid "E_D_AB_WHEEL_PREP_TWO"

msgstr "Kneel on the floor and hold the handles of the wheel roller with your arms extended."



msgid "E_D_AB_WHEEL_EXEC_ONE"

msgstr "Inhale and slowly roll the wheel forward until your torso is parallel to the ground."



msgid "E_D_AB_WHEEL_EXEC_TWO"

msgstr "Pause for a few seconds when your body is fully extended"



msgid "E_D_AB_WHEEL_EXEC_THREE"

msgstr "Exhale and pull the wheel back toward yourself to the starting position and repeat"



msgid "E_D_AB_WHEEL_TIP_ONE"

msgstr "To add difficulty, leave only your feet on the floor"



msgid "E_D_AB_WHEEL_TIP_TWO"

msgstr "Keep a straight back and braced core during the exercise"





Step 2-A:  

I will send you exercise txt file.

From that figure out FOCUS AREA list for creating ExerciseDefinition.

for example in Ab Wheel we have FOCUS AREA Abs, Shoulders, Back so the focus areas list are [FocusArea.ABDOMEN, FocusArea.SHOULDER, FocusArea.BACK]

find out which type of focus areas we deal with for each exercise, here is the FocusArea enums:



class FocusArea(StrEnum):

    """Enumeration for primary muscle groups targeted by an exercise."""

    ARM = 'arm'

    SHOULDER = 'shoulder'

    CHEST = 'chest'

    BACK = 'back'

    LEG = 'leg'

    BUTTOCKS = 'buttocks'

    ABDOMEN = 'abdomen'

    FULL_BODY = 'full_body'





Step 2-B: 

I will send you exercise txt file.

From that figure out Exercise Equipment list for creating ExerciseDefinition.

For example in Ab Wheel we have FOCUS AREA Abs, Shoulders, Back so the focus areas list are [FocusArea.ABDOMEN, FocusArea.SHOULDER, FocusArea.BACK]

Find out which type of focus areas we deal with for each exercise, here is the ExerciseEquipment enums:
Do not add to ExerciseEquipment enum, instead figure it out what each exercise use? 
for example for an exercise with a roller nearest option whould be body weight or for a pull-up bar the nearest option would be weight machine


class ExerciseEquipment(StrEnum):

    BODY_WEIGHT = 'body_weight'

    BENCH = 'bench'

    WEIGHT_MACHINE = 'weight_machine'

    CABLE_MACHINE = 'cable_machine'

    BARBELL = 'barbell'

    DUMBBELL = 'dumbbell'

    BAND = 'band'

    KETTLEBELL = 'kettlebell'

    SMITH_MACHINE = 'smith_machine'





Step 3: 

base on exercise name and execution steps and your exercise history database guess the best ExerciseMetricType 

for example Ab Wheel is ExerciseMetricType.REPS_ONLY type.

find out which type of exercise ExerciseMetricType we deal with , here is the ExerciseMetricType enums:



class ExerciseMetricType(StrEnum):

    """

    Enumeration for how an exercise's performance is measured.

    Renamed from 'ExerciseRecordType' for clarity.

    """

    REPS_ONLY = 'reps_only' 

    PERCENT_1RM_AND_REPS = 'percent_1rm_and_reps'  

    TIME_BASED = 'time_based'



Step 4: 

Base on information you gathered in last steps, create ExerciseDefinition

Hre is the final create ExerciseDefinition result for provided exercise example:

        ExerciseDefinition(

            id='exercise-1',

            title= "E_D_AB_WHEEL_TITLE",

            video_urls=['regular_directory/exercises/videos/ab_wheel.mp4'],

            cover_image_url=['regular_directory/exercises/images/ab_wheel.png'],

                preparation_steps=[

                    'E_D_AB_WHEEL_PREP_ONE',

                    'E_D_AB_WHEEL_PREP_TWO'

                ],

                execution_steps=[

                    'E_D_AB_WHEEL_EXEC_ONE',

                    'E_D_AB_WHEEL_EXEC_TWO',

                    'E_D_AB_WHEEL_EXEC_THREE'

                ],

                key_tips=[

                    'E_D_AB_WHEEL_TIP_ONE',

                    'E_D_AB_WHEEL_TIP_TWO'

                ],

            focus_areas=[FocusArea.ABDOMEN, FocusArea.SHOULDER, FocusArea.BACK],

            equipment=ExerciseEquipment.BODY_WEIGHT,

            metric_type=ExerciseMetricType.REPS_ONLY

        )



Step 6: Create a  simple python list and return exercises you created 

class ExercisesDefinition:

    """Container class holding a list of all defined ExerciseDefinition objects."""

    exercises: List[ExerciseDefinition] = [

        ExerciseDefinition(

            id='exercise-1',

            title= "E_D_AB_WHEEL_TITLE",

            video_urls=['regular_directory/exercises/videos/ab_wheel.mp4'],

            cover_image_url=['regular_directory/exercises/images/ab_wheel.png'],

                preparation_steps=[

                    'E_D_AB_WHEEL_PREP_ONE',

                    'E_D_AB_WHEEL_PREP_TWO'

                ],

                execution_steps=[

                    'E_D_AB_WHEEL_EXEC_ONE',

                    'E_D_AB_WHEEL_EXEC_TWO',

                    'E_D_AB_WHEEL_EXEC_THREE'

                ],

                key_tips=[

                    'E_D_AB_WHEEL_TIP_ONE',

                    'E_D_AB_WHEEL_TIP_TWO'

                ],

            focus_areas=[FocusArea.ABDOMEN, FocusArea.SHOULDER, FocusArea.BACK],

            equipment=ExerciseEquipment.BODY_WEIGHT,

            metric_type=ExerciseMetricType.REPS_ONLY

        ),

]
Start ExerciseDefinition id use 'exercise-index' format for id and start from index 322
